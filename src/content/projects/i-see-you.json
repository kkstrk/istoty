        ["'It’s a story about four elements: water, air, earth and fire. During the journey we discover what is native and indestructible in us, to move assuredly through unpredictable four elements. Since the beginning of time, we celebrate one flickering ember that sparks strength in each of us. I invite you, child and adult, to realize an uplifting power that your dreams hold.' A dance-show inspired by the Avatar’s world, for the audience to follow emotions of this visual and sensory journey, into the quest of one's own innate power."],
